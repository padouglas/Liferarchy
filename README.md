# Liferarchy
Goals and tasks planning application, where all items can be organised hierarchically.

This is going to be a C# & Windows Forms application (at least initially; not ruled out changing technologies later on!), that will allow you to enter life goals and associated tasks.  Analysis of whether you are on track, output of pretty graphs, reminders, etc. are all features that will hopefully be implemented.

The "key" feature is that the goals will be hierarchical, in that goals may contain other goals. (Might be the same for tasks....not sure yet).  This comes from my frustration with similar applications, in that they all seem to enforce arranging goals as a flat list.
